                        <p>
                            When planning your landscape design, consider your soil type, local climate, property size, and intended use of the space. Think
                            about whether you want areas for entertaining, relaxing, gardening, or children's play. Also evaluate sunlight patterns, drainage
                            needs, and how the design will complement your home's architecture. Understanding these factors upfront helps create a functional
                            and beautiful outdoor space.

                    <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="How do I choose the right plants for my garden?">
                        <p>
                            Select plants based on your USDA planting zone and local climate conditions. Consider the amount of sunlight each area receives,
                            your soil type, and water requirements. Native plants are often the best choice as they're adapted to local conditions and require
                            less maintenance. Group plants with similar needs together and think about seasonal interest - choose a mix of evergreens, flowering
                            plants, and foliage that provides year-round appeal.

                    <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="What does the landscape design process typically involve?">
                        <p>
                            The landscape design process begins with an initial consultation to discuss your vision and needs. This is followed by a thorough
                            site analysis examining terrain, soil, climate, and existing vegetation. Next comes concept development with preliminary designs,
                            then detailed planning including specific plant and material selections. Finally, the installation phase brings your design to life
                            with proper planting and construction.

                    <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="How can I make my landscape design more sustainable?">
                        <p>
                            Create a sustainable landscape by using native plants that require less water and maintenance, implementing efficient irrigation
                            systems like drip irrigation, and incorporating rain gardens to manage stormwater runoff. Consider xeriscaping techniques for
                            drought-resistant areas, use organic mulch to retain moisture, and select durable materials for hardscaping that won't need frequent
                            replacement.
                        </p>
                    </AccordionItem>
                    <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="What maintenance considerations should I keep in mind?">
                        <p>
                            Plan for ongoing maintenance from the design stage by choosing low-maintenance plants and durable materials. Ensure easy access to
                            all garden areas for pruning and care. Consider plant growth patterns to avoid overcrowding, incorporate mulch to suppress weeds and
                            retain moisture, and think about automated irrigation systems. Even low-maintenance gardens need some care, so budget for regular
                            watering, pruning, and seasonal cleanups.
                        </p>

                    <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="How much should I expect to spend on landscape design?">
                        <p>
                            Landscape design costs vary widely based on the size, scope, and complexity of your project. Basic designs like simple patios may
                            start around $1,500, while comprehensive master plans including outdoor kitchens, lighting, and custom features can cost $5,000 or
                            more. Generally, design fees represent 2-4% of your total construction budget. Remember that professional design is an investment
                            that maximizes the value of your construction dollars and helps avoid costly mistakes.
                        </p>

                    <AccordionItem name="exclusive" title="Do I need to have a clear vision before hiring a landscape designer?">
                        <p>
                            No, you don't need to know exactly what you want before hiring a designer. Simply wanting to improve your outdoor space is enough to
                            get started. The design process will help you explore options, define goals, and discover features you may not have considered. A
                            good designer will guide you through understanding what's possible on your property and what works best for your lifestyle, family
                            needs, and budget.
